// this file will be used to route all calls to the backend
const express = require("express");

// will need routes for login, register, make resume, add content, edit content, remove info, replace basic info

// look into pools for db connection (make connection here then pass it along)

// start simple w/ username/password auth then proceed to try other things

// do research on proper ways to structure database / code base before starting to write code

// keep trying stuff on the test repo to save time in the future

// files needed for auth/login things, resume saving/adding info, more to discuss later
